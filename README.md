# european-population
My contribution to the final training project was cleaning two Eurostat datasets on migrations for research on the European population and creating the dashboard, using Power BI.

## Description
My focus was researching migrations and their impact on the European population. Starting from two datasets from Eurostat, I normalized the data using Pandas, then I contributed to the creation of the dashboard. A demonstrative PDF with the resulting dashboard and analysis is also included here.

#### Note: This project was developed as part of a training program in collaboration with three coursemates. It was created in a formative environment and may contain imperfections. The repository serves as a showcase of the coding and technical skills acquired during the training experience.
